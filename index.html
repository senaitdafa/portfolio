        <div class="txt2"><h3>Heritage</h3><p class="story-text">The long form of my name is Senait Habte Dafa Jatu Manda Custa Matcha Dalle Darre Gumbo Oroma. Each one of my last names represents my paternal ancestor beginning with my father Habte, my grandpa Dafa, and so on. My last, last name is the founding father of my dad's ethic group: the Oroma people of Ethiopia.  Ioften feel isolated from my family's culture, but in those moments, remembering the meaning of my name helps.</p>

However, I have managed to get a few reads in this year that I would like to share, as well as the few that let me down.</p></div>
